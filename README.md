# STAT_6315_Final_Project

For the final project in Inference I, I conducted a literature review of cylindrical statistical models and produced an example Bayesian analysis of the Abe-Ley model using wind and pollution data from Milwaukee, WI.

The Report summarizes the history of cylindrical statistical models and presents the results of the analysis of the Abe-Ley model applied to the Milwaukee, WI data. 

The sampler used for the Abe-Ley analysis is implemented in both R and RCpp. Additional files for graphics are available as well.

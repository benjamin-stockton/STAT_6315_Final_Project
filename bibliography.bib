A general class of models is proposed in which the mean direction and dispersion of a von Mises variate are related to the explanatory variables by general link functions. Appropriate regression diagnostics, estimation and testing procedures are developed for fitting the models. The meaning of "correlation" between an angular and a linear variable is clarified, and leads to a general notion of multiple correlation associated with the regression model. The methods are applied to a set of data arising from a study of movements of intertidal gastropods.},

	abstract = {Missing data is a common complication in data analysis. In many medical settings missing data can cause difficulties in estimation, precision and inference. Multiple imputation (MI) (Multiple Imputation for Nonresponse in Surveys. Wiley: New York, 1987) is a simulation-based approach to deal with incomplete data. Although there are many different methods to deal with incomplete data, MI has become one of the leading methods. Since the late 1980s we observed a constant increase in the use and publication of MI-related research. This tutorial does not attempt to cover all the material concerning MI, but rather provides an overview and combines together the theory behind MI, the implementation of MI, and discusses increasing possibilities of the use of MI using commercial and free software. We illustrate some of the major points using an example from an Alzheimer disease (AD) study. In this AD study, while clinical data are available for all subjects, postmortem data are only available for the subset of those who died and underwent an autopsy. Analysis of incomplete data requires making unverifiable assumptions. These assumptions are discussed in detail in the text. Relevant S-Plus code is provided.

	abstract = {Mainstream statistical methodology is generally applicable to data observed in Euclidean space. There are, however, numerous contexts of considerable scientific interest in which the natural supports for the data under consideration are Riemannian manifolds like the unit circle, torus, sphere and their extensions. Typically, such data can be represented using one or more directions, and directional statistics is the branch of statistics that deals with their analysis. In this paper we provide a review of the many recent developments in the field since the publication of Mardia and Jupp (1999), still the most comprehensive text on directional statistics. Many of those developments have been stimulated by interesting applications in fields as diverse as astronomy, medicine, genetics, neurology, aeronautics, acoustics, image analysis, text mining, environmetrics, and machine learning. We begin by considering developments for the exploratory analysis of directional data before progressing to distributional models, general approaches to inference, hypothesis testing, regression, nonparametric curve estimation, methods for dimension reduction, classification and clustering, and the modelling of time series, spatial and spatio-temporal data. An overview of currently available software for analysing directional data is also provided, and potential future developments discussed.},

The model segments the data by accounting for redundancies due to correlations along time and across variables. A computationally feasible expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is provided for the maximum likelihood estimation of the model from incomplete data, by treating the missing values and the states of the latent chain as two different sources of incomplete information. Importance-sampling methods facilitate the computation of bootstrap standard errors of the estimates. The methodology is illustrated on a bivariate time series of wind and wave directions and compared with popular segmentation models for bivariate circular data, which ignore correlations across variables and/or along time.},

In a frequentist setting, this type of model is plagued by the likelihood surface of its regression coefficients, which is not logarithmically concave. In a Bayesian context, a weakly informative prior solves this issue, while for other parametersnoninformative priors are available. In addition to an MCMC sampling algorithm, we develop Bayesian hypothesis tests based on the Bayes factor for both equality and inequality constrained hypotheses. In a simulation study, it can be seen that our method performs well. The analyses are available in the package CircGLMBayes. Finally, we apply this model to a dataset from experimental psychology, and show that it provides valuable insight for applied researchers.

It enables segmentation of the data within a finite number of latent classes that represent the conditional distributions of the data under specific environmental conditions, simultaneously accounting for unobserved heterogeneity and spatial auto-correlation. Further, it parsimoniously accommodates specific features of environmental cylindrical data, such as circular–linear correlation, multimodality and skewness. Because of the numerical intractability of the likelihood function, estimation of the parameters is based on composite likelihood methods and essentially reduces to a computationally efficient expectation–maximization algorithm that iteratively alternates the maximization of a weighted composite likelihood function with weights updating.

Examples of cylindrical data in psychology include human navigation (direction and distance of movement), eye-tracking research (direction and length of saccades) and data from an interpersonal circumplex (location and intensity on the IPC). In this paper we adapt four models for cylindrical data to include a regression of the circular and linear component onto a set of covariates. Subsequently, we illustrate how to fit these models and interpret their results on a dataset on the interpersonal behavior of teachers.},

It allows us to segment cylindrical time series according to a finite number of regimes that represent the conditional distributions of the data under specific environmental conditions. The model parsimoniously accommodates for circular–linear correlation, multimodality, skewness, and temporal autocorrelation. A computationally efficient expectation–maximization algorithm is described to estimate the parameters, and a parametric bootstrap routine is provided to compute confidence intervals. These methods are illustrated on cylindrical time series of wave heights and directions. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a Metropolis–Hastings algorithm based on Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, to estimate the parameters of the Abe–Ley distribution, which is a recently proposed Weibull-Sine-Skewed-von Mises mixture model, for bivariate circular-linear data. Current literature estimates the parameters of these mixture models using the expectation-maximization method, but we will show that this exhibits a few shortcomings for the considered mixture model. First, standard expectation-maximization does not guarantee convergence to a global optimum, because the likelihood is multi-modal, which results from the high dimensionality of the mixture’s likelihood. Second, given that expectation-maximization provides point estimates of the parameters only, the uncertainties of the estimates (e.g., confidence intervals) are not directly available in these methods. Hence, extra calculations are needed to quantify such uncertainty. We propose a Metropolis–Hastings based algorithm that avoids both shortcomings of expectation-maximization. Indeed, Metropolis–Hastings provides an approximation to the complete (posterior) distribution, given that it samples from the joint posterior of the mixture parameters. This facilitates direct inference (e.g., about uncertainty, multi-modality) from the estimation. In developing the algorithm, we tackle various challenges including convergence speed, label switching and selecting the optimum number of mixture components. We then (i) verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on sample datasets with known true parameters, and further (ii) validate our methodology on an environmental dataset (a traditional application domain of Abe–Ley mixtures where measurements are function of direction). Finally, we (iii) demonstrate the usefulness of our approach in an application domain where the circular measurement is periodic in time.},

	abstract = {Circular data are encountered throughout a variety of scientific disciplines, such as in eye movement research as the direction of saccades. Motivated by such applications, mixtures of peaked circular distributions are developed. The peaked distributions are a novel family of Batschelet-type distributions, where the shape of the distribution is warped by means of a transformation function. Because the Inverse Batschelet distribution features an implicit inverse that is not computationally feasible for large or complex data, an alternative called the Power Batschelet distribution is introduced. This distribution is easy to compute and mimics the behavior of the Inverse Batschelet distribution. Inference is performed in both the frequentist framework, through Expectation–Maximization (EM) and the bootstrap, and the Bayesian framework, through MCMC. All parameters can be fixed, which may be done by assumption to reduce the number of parameters. Model comparison can be performed through information criteria or through bridge sampling in the Bayesian framework, which allows performing a wealth of hypothesis tests through the Bayes factor. An R package, flexcircmix, is available to perform these analyses.},

We show the flexibility of our proposal, its closure under marginalization, and how to quantify multivariate dependence. Due to a non-identifiability issue that our proposal inherits from the projected normal, a computational problem arises. We overcome it in a Bayesian framework, adding suitable latent variables and showing that posterior samples can be obtained with a post-processing of the estimation algorithm output. Under specific prior choices, this approach enables us to implement a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm relying only on Gibbs steps, where the updates of the parameters are done as if we were working with a multivariate normal likelihood. The proposed approach can also be used with the projected normal. As a proof of concept, on simulated examples we show the ability of our algorithm in recovering the parameter values and to solve the identification problem. Then the proposal is used in a real data example, where the turning-angles (circular variables) and the logarithm of the step-lengths (linear variables) of four zebras are modeled jointly.},

In particular, we present a simple procedure to adapt Bernstein copulas to the circular framework and guarantee that the constructed bivariate distributions are strictly continuous.

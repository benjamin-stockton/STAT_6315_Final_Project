% The word limit for this is 250 words.
Over the past 45 years, two lineages from Mardia and Sutton \cite{mardia_model_1978} and Johnson and Wehrly \cite{johnson_angular-linear_1978} have developed to model and analyse cylindrical data, or bivariate data composed of a linear random variable and circular random variable. Models within these lineages were originally developed in a frequentist framework and only recently have been extended with the Bayesian, non-parametric, and semi-parametric methods. Inference has therefore been mainly developed for frequentist hypothesis testing while recent Bayesian approaches have focused on computational methods and model development than on inference in its own right. For the future, research seems to be focused on developing Bayesian methods and inference along with beginning to answer missing data questions. \\
